# Spinel - Secure access to internal websites

## Summary
Spinel (spiÂ·nell) is a small, fast, and secure authentication handler for Nginx that allows your organization to securely serve internal web applications over the public internet without requiring a VPN (Virtual Private Network) connection or other secure tunneling strategies.

It is very **fast** (typically adding less than 200 microseconds to a request), **simple** to setup with existing Nginx reverse proxies (requiring no special modules or compilation), and **secure** with tamper-proof sha256 checksums. Authentication rules can be setup to allow whitelisted ip ranges (specified as CIDR block) or require user login to an Active Directory domain.

## Production Readiness
